Creating a complete hotel accommodation system with C source code involves multiple components and functionalities, including managing rooms, reservations, guest information, and more. While I can't provide an entire system here due to its complexity, I can give you a simplified example of a basic hotel reservation system using C. Keep in mind that a real-world system would require much more code and considerations for security, error handling, and user interfaces.
